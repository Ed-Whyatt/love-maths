<h1 align="center">JavaScript Essentials Walkthrough Project - Love Maths</h1>

## [View The Live Project Here](#)

### This project is a fully responsive JavaScript maths game. It is a walkthrough project which is part of the learning JavaScript essentials lessons with Code Institute. It is designed to consolidate the concepts I have learned so far. However, it's also a learning experience. Designed to demonstrate how pure JavaScript works in a real-world context. I will also learn some more advanced JavaScript  that wasn't covered up until this point.

### The Love maths game consists of icons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The lesson will firstly wire up the first three though the walkthrough lessons and my challenge is to write the division game.


## HTML AND CSS BOILERPLATES

### Although the front-end styling is  important, we're going to focus more  on the JavaScript than the HTML and CSS. So some boilerplate files containing HTML and CSS  will be provided from Code Institute to copy and  paste into the development environment.

## WIREFRAMES

- ### When we look at our project we have a heading and we have a game area. And inside there we have two sections of material and a button. These are going to be called the classes of game area, controls area, and question area. The project have separate classes for our buttons and underneath that we have a score area.
